                        <p>The motherboard is the main circuit board of a computer that connects and allows communication between all the critical components of a system. It serves as the backbone that houses the CPU, memory, expansion cards, and provides connectivity for all peripherals.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="highlight-blue">How it works:</h3>
                        <p>It contains circuits, chipsets, and buses that transfer data between components. The motherboard's chipset determines what components are compatible and how they communicate. It also manages power distribution to all connected components.</p>

                        <p>The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is the primary component that executes instructions and processes data.

                        <p>The CPU fetches instructions from memory, decodes them, executes the operations, and then stores the results. Modern CPUs contain multiple cores that can process instructions simultaneously, and many include integrated graphics processors for basic display functions.</p>

                        <p>RAM (Random Access Memory) is the temporary, high-speed storage that holds data the CPU is actively using. It provides quick access to information that programs need to function, significantly improving system performance compared to retrieving data from storage drives.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="highlight-blue">How it works:</h3>
                        <p>Unlike storage drives, RAM is volatile memory that loses its data when power is turned off. It serves as a workspace for the CPU, temporarily storing program code, operating system functions, and data being processed. More RAM allows for more programs to run simultaneously without slowdowns.</p>

                        <p>Storage devices permanently store all your data, including the operating system, programs, documents, photos, videos, and games. Unlike RAM, storage retains information even when the computer is powered off, providing long-term data preservation.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="highlight-blue">How it works:</h3>
                        <p>There are several types of storage technologies. HDDs (Hard Disk Drives) use magnetic platters and mechanical read/write heads, while SSDs (Solid State Drives) use flash memory chips with no moving parts. NVMe SSDs connect directly to the PCIe bus for even faster speeds than SATA SSDs.</p>

                        <p>The graphics card (GPU) is responsible for rendering images, videos, and animations to display on your monitor. It handles the complex calculations needed for 3D graphics in games, video editing, 3D modeling, and other visually intensive tasks, offloading this work from the CPU.</p>

                        <p>Modern GPUs contain thousands of small processing cores working in parallel to render graphics. They have dedicated video memory (VRAM) to store textures, frame buffers, and other graphical data. GPUs also accelerate tasks like video encoding/decoding, AI processing, and scientific calculations.</p>

                        <p>Cooling systems remove heat generated by computer components, particularly the CPU and GPU, to prevent thermal throttling and potential damage. Effective cooling ensures optimal performance, stability, and longevity of your system, especially during intensive tasks like gaming or rendering.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="highlight-blue">How it works:</h3>
                        <p>There are several cooling methods: Air cooling uses heatsinks with metal fins to dissipate heat, paired with fans to move air. Liquid cooling circulates coolant through a closed loop to transfer heat from components to a radiator. Both methods work to maintain safe operating temperatures under load.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="highlight-blue">Types of cooling solutions:</h3>

                        <p>The Power Supply Unit (PSU) converts AC power from your wall outlet into the DC power that computer components require.

                        <p>The PSU transforms high-voltage alternating current into lower-voltage direct current through a series of transformers, capacitors, and voltage regulators. Modern PSUs use switching technology for higher efficiency. They also include protection circuits against overload, overvoltage, and short circuits.</p>
